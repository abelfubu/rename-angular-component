# Based on Move TS extension

The code in this folder is an adapted, refactored version of `Indexer` class and `FileItem` - `move()` method inside [Move TS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stringham.move-ts) VS Code extension.

The original code by Ryan Stringham can be found here: https://github.com/stringham/move-ts

His method for finding files and their dependencies within a repo was way faster than my original effort.
